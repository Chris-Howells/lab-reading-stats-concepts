1) The expected value is the average value of a random variable over an infinite amount of experiments

Whilst the mean is the result of adding the results of an experiment up and dividing them by the number of results (so over a small nubmer of experiments it many not
be the same as the expected value)

2)A problem with P values is that the given 0.05 to check if something is statistically significant or not may not apply to all cases. 
It is also often misinterpreted as'statistical non-significance' to mean there is no correlation which is not true.


The p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true, or the probability that the alternative hypothesis is false which is naother misconception.

3)I would A/B Test where two differnt buttons(the one the designer drew and the previous one) will be shown to two separate but similar samples - and then checking to see if the results
 show a differnce in clicks to determine if the button is noticably impactful by increasing clicks or not
